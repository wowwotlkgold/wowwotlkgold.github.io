        <h2>WoW Wotlk Classic gold for Sale, Why You Should Buy WoW Wotlk Gold?</h2>
        <p>
          Our website, <strong>WoW Wotlk Gold</strong> is a specialized web store
          for all <strong>WoW Classic: Wrath of the Lich King</strong> services. Just
          like WoW Classic and unlike WoW Shadowlands and the rest of the latest
          expansions like Battle for Azeroth,
          <strong>WoW Wotlk Classic Gold</strong> is a much needed resource,
          basically the door to every ability or goodie in the game. You will
          need thousands of <strong>WoW Wotlk gold</strong> coins ranging from
          spells and abilities expenditures, flying mounts (the epic one is
          costly), professions which can take tens of thousands gold coins in
          order to skill them up to the maximum 450 skill. Reputation, raiding
          consumables, the list goes on. Even though more gold is earned in
          Outlands than in the Azeroth, there is much greater expenditure/cost
          than in the Vanilla version. Few examples are, if you are looking to
          obtain the flying mounts, as soon as you reach level 80, you would
          probably waste all of your gold resources on gear and abilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          By <strong>buying a 5000 WoW Wotlk Gold</strong> package, you can easily
          obtain the fast 100% speed flying epic mount and get between the zones
          in Outland in a matter of minutes rather than running from post to
          post. By buying gold you save valuable time which you can use to do
          the things in the game which you actually love. Another example if why
          waste valubable time to spend all of your hard earned gold on training
          all spells and abilities, while 1000 gold package would suffice for it
          and you can accomplish all of this in a matter of minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet another example is reputation farming. You can spend weeks and
          months in order to get the desired reputation with Aldor or Scryer in
          Shattrath City by farming the neccessary signets and items like
          <a href="javascript:;" rel="nofollow">Fel Armaments</a> /
          <a href="javascript:;" rel="nofollow">Arcane Tomes</a>, while a 10000
          Gold package would suffice to buy all of the required items from the
          Auction House or other players. In turn your reputation will increase
          as soon as you purchase these items, you will get the desired gear
          which will enable you to participate in the forthcoming Raids like
          Karazhan, Maghteridon Lair, Gruul or Hellfire Citadell.
        </p>

        <p>
          The list of example can go on and on. One bigger difference than the
          Classic Vanilla version, the required amount of in-game items and
          materials costs can easily go over 20000 gold for raising the
          profession skill from 420 to 450, especially for crafting professions
          like Leatherworking, Blacksmithing, Jewelcrafting, Enchanting, Alchemy
          and Tailoring which in turn provide more high-end game goodies.
        </p>

        <h3>Why buy WoW Wotlk Gold from WoW Wotlk Gold?</h3>

        <p>
          We have been present on the WoW Wotlk market since 2014, way before the
          release of Classic in 2019. How so? Private servers. It was the
          popularity of the private servers like Nostalrius Begins that
          triggered the release of WoW Classic by Blizzard. Before the release,
          our website was providing services for all major private servers which
          had tens of thousands of players on each one. WoW Wotlk Gold was
          successfully covering all private WoW Wotlk, Vanill and Wotlk projects
          like: Nostalrius, Elysium and Elysium Wotlk, Atlantiss, Sunwell
          Angrathar and Nightbane, WoWOne(Feenix) Archangel, Warmane's Outland,
          Icecrown, Lordaeron among many others like
          <a href="javascript:;">Endless</a>, Hellfire and Hellground. Most of
          these projects were Wrath of the Lich King WoW projects. By knowing that, you
          can be certain that our level of experitise with WoW Wotlk is perhaps
          the highest, as we have been working on that version for years. We
          know the game inside out and can quickly farm the biggest amounts of
          <strong>WoW Wotlk Classic gold</strong> for all of our customers.
          Besides that, by knowing the game we will be able to provide you with
          <strong>the best WoW Wotlk boost services</strong> in all PvP and PvE
          areas of the game, including Arena and Honor Farm, Reputation and
          Profession skill up, GearScore improvements and Powerleveling, even
          from 1-80 or just the Wotlk content 58-70 (70-80). Please don't hesitate
          to get in touch if you have any questions.
        </p>

        <h3>Is it Safe to buy WoW Wotlk Classic Gold?</h3>

        <p>
          We assure you. There has not been a single of WoW Classic customer of
          ours that has been experiencing any kind of issue and we have
          performed more than 25000 different transactions and trades during the
          retail Vanilla 2019-2022. We follow up the latest trading and
          <strong>WoW Wotlk Gold delivery</strong> trends, so beside using in-game
          mail, we can also utilize direct trade (known as f2f), CoD or Auction
          House method if needed or required. We can also give you the desired
          amount of gold in tradeable items or gears, whatever your preference
          is.
        </p>

        <h2>WoW Classic: The Wrath of the Lich King... Wait, What?</h2>

        <p>
          Yes, as you have heard,
          <a href="javascript:;">Blizzard announced</a> the
          <a href="javascript:;">Wrath of the Lich King (re)release</a> as expansion to
          the already existing WoW Classic during 2022. The announcement was
          made during the yearly event known as Blizzcon (Blizzconline 2022 due
          to the Covid 19 pandemic). If you have been living under the rock, WoW
          Classic was released on August 26th 2019. Right now, the current
          active patch is Shadow of the Necropolis 1.12 and people are getting
          ready to migrate to the Wrath of the Lich King. As it was announced, shortly
          before the beta, players will be able to start leveling as Blood Elves
          or Draenei up to level 58, and then resume once
          <a href="javascript:;">Wrath of the Lich King Classic</a> is launched. Leaks
          confirm the launch will happen somewhere around 4th of May.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Wrath of the Lich King Classic... What's different than the original Classic?
        </h3>

        <p>
          In a nutshell, the 'storyline' moves from Azeroth (Kalimdor and
          Eastern Kingdoms) to Outland, which stands for 'what remains of the
          Shattered World of Draenor', the former home of the Draenei. The
          expansion features the inclusion of the Blood Elf races for the Horde
          and Draenei for the Alliance. Flying mounts are enabled in Outlands,
          17 new dungeons, 9 new raids including Sunwell Plateau and Black
          Temple where players can face the 'ruler' of Outland - Illidan
          Stormrage. The old Honor PvP system is gone and replaced with the
          popular Arena choice when players can fight for Arena PvP rating in
          2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 PvP combat.
        </p>

        <h2>WoW Wotlk Classic Boost Services from WoW Wotlk Gold.com</h2>

        <p>
          In addition to the much needed gold, boost and carry services are
          really needed for every segment and aspect of the game. Getting to
          exalted with Scryer or Aldor can take weeks or months, skilling up
          Jewelcrafting requires times, nerves and patience and many of us
          simply would prefer to jump straight in the Arena for some PvP. Even
          then, an improved rating will do much better than low ranking, so we
          can give you a hand in the Arena as well. Some of our boost services
          are listed below:

            Beside our website,
            <a href="javascript:;">WoW Wotlk Classic Gold & Boost</a> services can
            also be optained from our partner site MMORPGMALL. Our partner site
            used to function as one of the top performing WoW Classic services
            since Vanilal was launched back in 2019, covering all possible US
            and EU realms. Though both our sites belong to the same network,
            they are managed by different teams in order to better micro-manage
            all order and delivery processes for our customers. You can expect
            the same level of top-notch service on MMORPGMALL.com as well. The
            very same services you will on this website are also available
            there: Gold, boosts, powerleveling and account shop.

            Latest leaks by
            <a href="javascript:;" rel="nofollow">Nano</a> reveal that WoW
            Classic: Wrath of the Lich King Pre-Patch could be happening around the
            20th of April, with Fresh Vanilla Classic servers being released for
            those who would wish to remain in the 'WoW Classic' era, without
            resuming their journey to Wotlk. The information surrounding the leaks
            was started on this
            <a href="javascript:;" rel="nofollow">Reddit thread</a>. Whether
            this is true or not, it remains to be seen as April 20th is not far
            away, actually less than 2 months.
            <a href="javascript:;">Blizzcon</a> announcement revealed that in
            the Wotlk Pre-Patch both Draenei and the Blood Elves will be available
            for play up until level 58.
